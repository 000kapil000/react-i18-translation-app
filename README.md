with the help of load more button with improve our app performance 

**********************************************************************

Sticky Header---->

The header part of app is sticky it means you can scroll unlimited but you 
always see header part on the place it dosn't scroll to top when we start
scrolling so we cna axiss the header property any time anywhere also it's
shoing in all components of app
